## Introduction

ONNX provides a C++ library for performing arbitrary optimizations on ONNX models, as well as a growing list of prepackaged optimization passes.

The primary motivation is to share work between the many ONNX backend implementations. Not all possible optimizations can be directly implemented on ONNX graphs - some will need additional backend-specific information - but many can, and our aim is to provide all such passes along with ONNX so that they can be re-used with a single function call.

You may be interested in invoking the provided passes, or in implementing new ones (or both).

## Installation

You can install onnxoptimizer from PyPI:

```bash
pip3 install onnxoptimizer
```

Note that you may need to upgrade your pip first if you have trouble:

```bash
pip3 install -U pip
```

If you want to build from source:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/onnx/optimizer onnxoptimizer
cd onnxoptimizer
pip3 install -e .
```

Note that you need to install protobuf before building from source.

## Roadmap

* Command-line API (e.g. `python3 -m onnxoptimizer model.onnx output.onnx`)
* More built-in pass
* Separate graph rewriting and constant folding (or a pure graph rewriting mode, see [issue #9](https://github.com/onnx/optimizer/issues/9) for the details)

## Relevant tools

* [onnx-simplifier](https://github.com/daquexian/onnx-simplifier): A handy and popular tool based on onnxoptimizer
